## Getting started

`Next.js` requires [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org).

If you don't already have `npm` and `yarn` available, make sure you set them up.

```bash
npm i -g npm yarn
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

If yarn is not working in PowerShell type this command in PowerShell with administrator privileges

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

To start dev server run this command
```bash
npm run dev
```
